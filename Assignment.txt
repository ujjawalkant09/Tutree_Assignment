Question: Explain dimension reduction in machine learning.

-> Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing 
   the number of random variables under consideration ,
   by obtaining a set of principal variables. It can be
   divided into feature selection and feature extraction.


Question: How can you handle duplicate values in a 
          dataset for a variable in Python using pandas?
 
          df = pd.read_csv('file.csv')

->  First we have to check for duplicates for that we will 
    use 
    df.duplicated()  
    So this will return pandas series and give us information about duplicates
    
   To checks if there are duplicate values in a particular column of your DataFrame.
   we will use : 
   df.duplicated("col_name")

   Getting rid of duplicates :
   
   Getting rid of duplicate records is easy.
   Just use : df.drop_duplicates()
   from this command we will drop all the duplicate values .
